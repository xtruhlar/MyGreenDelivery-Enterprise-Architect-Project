# MyGreenDelivery Enterprise Architect Project
## The intention of the project
### MyGreenDelivery
MyGreenDelivery is a software application designed to make package delivery more efficient, while putting
emphasis on delivery ecology. Its main actors are courier drivers who can be professional drivers
or individuals registered in the system, and customers ordering delivery. The application allows
simple and efficient delivery of shipments with regard to customer preferences and an ecological approach.

### Functionalities
One of the key functions of the system is real-time shipment tracking as well as calculation
optimized routes. Users have the option to choose between two delivery modes - Flash, which
focuses on speed, and Eco, which favors greener delivery. Eco mode is subsidized
the operator of the application and other partners, which makes it more financially advantageous for the customer.
The system calculates routes to minimize emission production and optimize delivery based on
current traffic and weather conditions. Customers can also select a preferred delivery time and
add notes such as "Leave at back door". Alternatively, they can use package boxes or
delivery via acquaintance or post.

### Drivers and user interface
For drivers, the application provides an overview of the nearest customers to prevent unnecessary
extension of routes and increase in emissions, planned shipments and mandatory breaks during working hours.
Information on the traffic situation and earned funds or saved CO2 emissions is also available. The system
is designed to provide a clear user interface (GUI) that allows drivers and customers
to quickly access the necessary information.

### Security and feedback
The security of delivery is ensured by authentication of drivers and customers. When picking up the shipment in person
at the delivery address, the customer must provide a code and have his mobile phone with him so that the two devices can connect using
Bluetooth technology and thus confirm the receipt of the shipment from hand to hand, or from depot to hand,
when delivering to a box, a photo is required as proof. Customers can rate the quality of delivery and the system optimizes its services based on the feedback.

### Notifications and gamification

MyGreenDelivery provides notifications about the order status for both actors â€“ customers and drivers.
Notifications include information about delivery changes, delays or early arrivals. The system also uses gamification elements to promote eco-friendly behavior, where drivers and customers earn green tickets in exchange for eco-
deliveries. These tickets can be exchanged for discounts or products from partner organizations in the e-shop, which is integrated into the application. In addition, the driver's salary is affected by the environmental coefficient - EkoKf, which is calculated as the ratio of delivered shipments to the number of green or optimally driven kilometers.
